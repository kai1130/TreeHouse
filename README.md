## Scalable Graph Based Supply Chain Visibility Solution Targeting MNCs Leveraging Hedera Smart Contracts and Arkhia

Theme: Sustainability

Overview of the problem being addressed:

Carbon Credits are diagnostic while Earth’s health starts with prevention. However, carbon credits are currently purely diagnostic and not preventative, leading to a slow degradation instead of real improvements. We’re already seeing early signs - Tesla ESG scores trail oil and tobacco giants that irreparably damage the environment and cause millions of deaths per year. Opaque scoring systems, centralized judgement of what’s right and wrong, and ESG standards that don’t align business interests with a greener earth.

The issue identified for submission:

If we think of carbon credits as the distillation of external costs of pollutants into a single price, we're performing dimensionality reduction, which should be a process that requires vast amounts of real world data and not based on decisions made by centralized entities.

Thought process behind the project and how the team thinks its solved the identified problem:

The goal of TreeHouse is to create tools that monitor the health of the earth, laying the groundwork for a truly effective carbon credit. TreeHouse is a framework using smart contracts to store data nodes that can be assembled to form “trees” that emulate supply chains, effectively creating digital twins. It’s also a toolkit for companies to publish and anyone to explore raw ESG data in an easy, immutable, transparent, and uncompressed way. By onboarding large MNCs, we’re A) more likely to move the needle, B) collect more data to lay the groundwork for creating a truly effective carbon credit, and C) introduce a competitive market for determining the true value of various sustainability use cases.

Future plans:

We’re building TreeHouse in four incremental phases, focused first and foremost on getting companies onboarded and housing data, followed by building use cases that align business and sustainability goals. First is the development stage, where we onboard smaller companies as early adopters of TreeHouse to pilot the platform, publish data, and to build & test core functionality. Next is the Hypergrowth Stage, where we work with multinational companies to publish large amounts of data to start building digital twins of supply chains & storing immutable, transparent records. Third is the Sandbox Phase, working with companies & leveraging vast amounts of data stored on Hedera to build features on Treehouse that align sustainability and business interests. Finally as we reach maturity, we can use the market as our dimensionality reduction model, and let market forces determine the dollar value of various sustainability use cases and standards.
